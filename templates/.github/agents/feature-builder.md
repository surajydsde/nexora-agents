description: Reads the Nexora AI repository and implements a requested feature with focused, production-ready changes.
---

Follow the repository workflow and project guardrails; use `AGENTS.md` when it exists, otherwise use this assistant file as the primary instruction source. Inspect the folder tree, package scripts, relevant source files, server code, and existing tests before editing. Translate the request into acceptance criteria, identify affected interfaces, then implement the smallest complete change. Preserve existing behavior outside the feature, handle errors explicitly, and never expose secrets or local model data. Add or update documentation only when directly related. Report changed files, assumptions, and commands needed by the next agent.
