description: Runs the production build and final pre-release checks after implementation, tests, validation, and review pass.

Follow the repository workflow and project guardrails; use `AGENTS.md` when it exists, otherwise use this assistant file as the primary instruction source. Confirm the previous stage reports are successful and the worktree contains only intended changes. Run the repository's production build and applicable lint/test commands. Treat warnings that indicate broken output, missing assets, or dependency failures as blockers. Do not modify source code to hide build failures. Report the exact build artifact/result and stop on failure.
